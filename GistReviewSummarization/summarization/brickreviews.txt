I think this might be my first time giving five stars to a restaurant and being completely confident about doing so. If you haven't been here before WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ?! The boyfriend and I decided to finally stop in after many months of "oh we should try that" and I was not disappointed. I got a regular calzone (extra ricotta, basil, mozzarella and red sauce) which was drizzled in a garlicky olive oil. It was absolutely amazing. Completely filled with ricotta and basil and is just heaven on a plate. Our waitress was also very  friendly and on top of things. Will be returning !

Brick Pizzeria Napoletana is so good you'd think it were in New York or Providence, one of the major "Pizza Cities" in the US... but if you did you'd be wrong. Brick is located on good 'ol Union Street in New Bedford, right between Destination Soups and a cute little women's clothing store. My husband and I popped in on a whim and we ate a delicious, complete meal at a very reasonable price. We ordered two small salads to start, I got the spinach and he got the chopped one and both were tasty and served with a side of sour dough bread. For our main course we split the Capricciosa, a brick oven pie with prosciutto, olives, and artichokes. One pie is definitely enough for two but you probably won't have any leftovers, especially if you don't order an appetizer to start. For drinks, I got a cider and he got a beer and I was a little disappointed to receive my drink from a can but I guess they don't have much on tap yet. Great food, nice location, will definitely be back in the future.

Outstanding food and service. Best pizza on the south coast. Our server Eric did a great job

Here's the thing that not many people seem to realize about New Bedford: aside from the somewhat scary underbelly that seems to taint every corner of the city, it's pretty cool. The great local businesses that are popping up in clusters are definitely worth your time, and Brick especially. This pizza, kids -- it's perfection. I can wolf down an entire margherita pie by myself in under 5 minutes. It's that effing delish. The crust is a perfect mix of crispy and pillowy, and the sourdough flavor sends me into a blissed-out stupor. My other favorite? The rucola -- a white pizza with fresh mozz, prosciutto, and arugula topped with olive oil and lemon juice. Now, I'll admit I was a bit apprehensive to order a pizza without sauce, but only because their sauce is SO GOOD. You can taste the quality of the tomatoes in this bright, fresh masterpiece -- I could probably slurp down a vat of this sauce if they let me. Anyway, I was not the least bit disappointed in the lack of sauce on the rucola as the flavors were so totally perfectly balanced I almost ordered another to take home with me. Absolutely delicious. The space is cozy and casual -- nothing fancy or precious about it. They offer a lot of different pizzas, as well as salads, calzones and desserts. Gluten-free? No worries: all pies and calzones can be made with GF dough for just $2 more. Sweet.

This pizza is the real deal.  While I have a deep love for New England bar pies this is full on Italian style.  Fresh ingredients, friendly service, and a decent local beer selection makes this place one I will return to.

Well that was pretty tasty.  After seeing all the great reviews we decided to give Brick Pizzeria Napoletana a try.  They were doing a good business but we were easily able to get a table.   This place is fairly small so I can see there being a wait during peak hours.   To my husband's dismay there were no draft beers, but they had a full complement of Buzzards Bay Brewing 22 oz bottles.   The wine list was decent and I went with the Barbera which I enjoyed.   We started with the Spiedini, which is prosciutto wrapped around mozzarella and served over arugula.   The prosciutto was a bit salty, but that is to be expected.   I'm not sure if I would order this again. I think I would prefer a salad.  The pizzas are 12 inches.   Since this was our first visit we decided to order two and bring home the extra.  We ordered a white pizza, the Napoli, which had prosciutto, mushrooms, basil and asiago.   For a red pizza we ordered a margherita and added sausage and roasted garlic.   The pizza had a nice thin, crispy crust and a sourdough tang.  I did prefer the red pizza.  If I lived in the area I could see this being my regular pizza place.  I would definitely visit again if I were looking for pizza while in New Bedford.

Downtown New Bedford is changing for the better, and small businesses like Brick is a part of the change. This is the only place in the city I'll go for pizza.

Excellent! Went here on first night with hubby and 11 yr old daughter. Great atmosphere, service is spectacular- felt like we were a guest for dinner at a friends home, and the food.... Wow! We started with a bruschetta- fresh soft pizza dough/bread drizzled with just enough olive oil, fresh basil, mozzarella, Romano all melted and warm - oh and slices of tomatoes. Then for our meal- my daughter had the bambino 6" pizza, hubby had grilled cheese - both came on the same pizza dough as the bruschetta the pizza had just enough sauce with the perfect amount of cheese for my little fussy girl, the grilled cheese had four yummy kinds of cheese perfectly melted inside that soft pizza dough/bread, I had the supreme salad that was a fresh spring salad mix with delicious olives, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, purple onions, pepper chinos, Romano cheese all drizzled with  a delicious  vinaigrette  We would definitely   return and also would highly recommend this gem of a restaurant to family and friends

At Brick, quality ingredients, consistency, and a hot fire go a long way to set a high bar on a familiar staple.Fresh elegant salads, simple and inventive pizzas, excellent service, and a focused wine and beer list make this place an easy choice for a knock-out meal worth driving for (we often drive over 30 minutes to eat here)Something magic happens in that brick oven! The toppings melt into pillowy dough and the edges of the crust rise and crisp. They start out with great ingredients, like silky roasted garlic, tender arugula, fragrant olive oil, and sweet and briny white anchovies (don't miss the anchovies, they aren't those salty little chewy strips you are imagining) which makes all the difference for a unique, harmonious, and delicious pie.They do also offer fresh cannoli and Nutella pizzas for dessert, but we are always too full from the killer pizza and awesome beers to try them.This restaurant is a great contributor to the growing culture of downtown New Bedford, don't miss it!

Brick Pizzeria Napoletana's pizza is a pleasant hybrid between an artisan, crispy thin crust and a thicker regular crust pizza.The best thinner, but chewy crust I've ever had! MMMM! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.My boyfriend and I sought out cooler weather during a hot summer day in the big PVD city, and we traveled to New Bedford on a whim. (Who doesn't want to go to a whaling museum?! Kidding.... or not?) We found Brick Pizzaeria Napoletana on Yelp.Um, yeah, I still think about their pizza! This is the pizza-version of the one-that-got-away (because we can't visit all the time!). We ordered the Funghi and Napoli pizzas, and it was super delish. They honestly made our hour drive worth it. Not too greasy, and I've never had such a great-tasting, chewy, thin crust. Crust is usually never the star of the meal, but their crust was top-notch!I also like that you can please everyone here: the actual restaurant space is nice and clean, and you can get fancy ingredients (asiago and prosciutto) combined with traditional toppings (pepperoni) on a more hearty crust! Love it! You've taken a pizza-my-heart, Brick.

I enjoyed dining at Brick.  A decent selection of wines and an interesting choice of bottled local beers, including 22oz bombers, made up for no drafts.  I chose the Olde Buzzard pale, an ESB that I've purchased for home consumption, but don't often see available when dining out.We chose the Spiedini as our starter -- mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto and served over arugula flavored with lemon-- pretty nice.We chose a red and a white pizza for our main course, thinking we'd take a few slices home.  OK so we ate most of it.  We chose a Margherita and Napoli, respectively, and they were also quite good.Service was also quite good, contributing to an overall really nice time out.  With so many options, including flatbread, that need to be tried, I think we need to return, maybe a few times.

Every time I come in I am impressed. The food is unbelievable... The salads are chock full of everything delicious you could imagine. I am currently eating the spinach salad and I'm in heaven... Full walnuts, roasted red peppers, onions, full size crouton! Oh my. The pizza and sandwiches are heaven. The service is amazing. Relaxed atmosphere. I love this place more and more. Definitely best lunch place in New Bedford.

Delicious brick oven pizza in downtown new bedford fresh ingredients real pizza good prices

Yum!  I was looking for an excellent pizza experience and I had one!  The salsiciatta pizzetta was fantastically fresh & tasty.  The restaurant is cozy, comfortable and open.  A great stop for lunch or dinner!

They are making real pizza here. It's as good as in Italy, or any proper pizza shop here in Chicago, etc. I ordered one and lost control and ordered another. I ate, a lot, and was so stuffed that I skipped dinner, breakfast, lunch, and resumed eating the next day during dinner. This usually doesn't happen. Great value, great service, great everything. Did I mention how great this place is???

DO NOT PASS UP THIS PIZZA!!!  Food and service were excellent. Too bad we can't transplant this pizzeria to Los Angeles. Me and my husband drive truck for a living. Had a delivery in the area and some locals down the street opening up a burger joint said it was the BEST pizza in the city. We agreed!!

My wife and I have visited Brick several times, and have always enjoyed the pizza and beer.  I cannot say we have a favorite, because we have yet to have the same pizza twice.  Every pizza we try, we like.  Local brews go great with the pizza - too bad it is not possible to have a beer and a pizza outside in the courtyard.  You will have to stay indoors to have a beer with your pizza.  Pizza cooks fast in that hot wood-fired oven.  Arrive hungry, and you will not have to wait long to satisfy your appetite.

It was so wonderfully laid out, it's hard to even see how great it is inside until you are up close, but it was completely packed which was a surprise for a Sunday night. We were able to get in and have one of their beautiful booth tables which have plenty room on both sides and excellent tops. For drinks she had the white wine which was from a bottle she said (!?!) and I had the Mayflower Winter Oatmeal Stout which was not only an excellent beer to begin with, but truly perfect with the pizza. She ordered the Red Pepper and Onion, and I had the Pesto with Chicken. The pizzas are done in a very hot brick oven here and the result was just fantastic. Pizzas are something I make quite a bit at home so it seems to be more of a surprise that I even get them when out but what can I say, I LOVE it when it's done well and this pizza was really just amazing. Fresh toppings, an excellent cheese blend and really excellent sauce all around made for a great start, but the crust was magical, just superb. The areas of pesto sauce on mine were perfectly portioned and just perfect. Her pizza was exceptional as well, it was really an excellent meal, another we just will never forget in this wondrous city of New Bedford.

The food is simple but excellent.  We were a "party of 7" (4 adults, 3 kids) which resulted in a disaster at the table by one of the kids.  Our waitress was extremely helpful during the entire dinner, and especially when we had our minor disaster.We would go back for the food, the atmosphere, and the waitstaff.

Well, our long awaited dining adventure to Brick came to fruition last night. First off, I have to say, I love New Bedford. The dining options are great and the bars are so fun. Brick offered a fun start to a wonderful night. The dining room is really a typical bright pizza place. The menu is creative and the wine list, affordable. Our server was friendly and attentive. We ordered the Caprese with Proscuitto on one half for my meat eating boyfriend and we also ordered the Puntanesca pizza. For wine we chose a Montepulciano (22.00). Pizzas fire up quick here. Had high expectations based on Yelp reviews. Regretfully, I wasn't blown away. I didn't feel they possessed any real flavor if that makes sense. We enjoyed our night overall but was not wowed by the pizza compared to other places we enjoy.

I was at the waterfront in New Bedford and the whaling museum and decided a quick pizza was in order.The place is nice, somewhat crowded but not packed when I went and I think they could have kept the floors and tables a little cleaner.We had a salad beer and wine to start, not a great beer and wine selection but better than none.The salad was very fresh and well made just acceptable price for the volume.The pizza was great, we tried a few and all very fresh and above average for the area. They get a few stars off for habits of the kitchen help.It is an open kitchen. I did not see one person wearing gloves, that's ok if you wash your hands, but I saw one worker go outside then come in and start to handle food. no hand washing or sanitizing.Imagine what germs are on that door from the outside!One of the people that cleared tables, also went into the kitchen area, sorted the stuff off the tray, handled trash, then picked up an order to bring it to a table?The owner/manager or both need to sit and observe and teach anyone that enters the kitchen area safe food handling techniques.

Wasn't expecting this place at all.  Wish I had one at home because I would go there all the time.  My husband and I don't like the same ingredients on pizza. The best part is they let you get an appetizer size of any of their pizzas so we didn't have to split. Everyone in the fan left happy and full!

Just got home, stuffed from eating my entire GLUTEN FREE PIZZA brick oven pizza The best in 13 years.  They make their own crust, not the frozen cardboard most places serve.  Our server was awesome, not sure who was happier that i was enjoying it so much, her or I,  Brick is cozy clean, people are great.  Will make this a regular haunt, glad I live close!

Creative and delicious pizza.  I especially like the carmelized onion with mushrooms.  The service was friendly and fast.  Easy parking and a lovely outdoor seating area.  We always dot here on the way to the cape.

Brought Dad along for Father's day and he absolutely enjoyed it. Not only was he shocked at the freshness of their ingredients, but he also claimed that his tastebuds have been "awakened"! He also said that this was the first in a long line of lunch visits for the wonderful food offered there! Keep up the great work guys! You're officially my family's favorite pizzeria!

I was actually a little nervous heading into New Bedford to try this place but since the yelp reviews were so good and since I got sick of the chain restaurants near the hotel I headed over to give it a try. This place is simply amazing. I sat at that counter and watched the owner make the pizzas and organize them in the brick wood fire. Everything about my pizza was perfect; the dough, the toppings, the taste. Hands down one of the best pizzas I've ever had.

Killer and unique gluten free pizza! They make their own gluten free dough in house and it's amazingly doughy and chewy in the best way! Cozy and warm atmosphere and a pretty decent beer/cider and wine selection.

Everybody loves it -- read their reviews -- and they are not lying.  I stopped here on my way home from the Cape but I plan to go out of my way and drive there from Providence soon.  It's really good.

I've been to Brick a few times now, so I can definitively say, it's quite wonderful. Like most Downtown NB joints, it's such a little gem. They've expanded now, and are situated next to an open air court yard that, in the summer is quite perfect for enjoying your meal. I've had a number of different items on the menu, but the last time I visited, I started off with a glass of prosecco and the spiedini, which is prosciutto wrapped mozzarella that has been baked in their wood-fired pizza ovens and served over a lemon vinaigrette dressed arugula salad. While it tasted wonderful, the prosciutto/mozzarella, whether it had been over cooked, or out of the oven too long before being served, seemed a bit tougher than it should have been. I couldn't even tell you what I had for my main entree (I'm writing this review long after I should have). I believe I made my own pizetta (a appetizer size of any of their regular pizzas that's only $5.19 and definitely enough for one person after having an appetizer). As you can tell by their name, they cook all their pizzas to order in a brick oven, and therefore, after a short run in the million degree oven, your pizza is delivered piping hot, fresh and ready to be eaten. The cheese is gooey, the crust is doughy, with just enough bite and the toppings are all fresh. I've also had their full sized pizzas, their pizzas with salads on top and their calzones, all of which are also wonderful. I can't wait to go back and try dessert there at some point (cannolis and a nutella pizza), can you even stand it??

Pizza is prepared quickly. Short wait time. Pest Pollo was delicious. But I LOVE pesto!Spiedini for appetizer was o.k.

Delicious pizza, especially the spinaci. I love that they serve down east cider there. Definitely a cool spot, just a little too expensive to make it a regular habit.

so so good.  I have tried many diff pizzas there and they are all good.if you haven't tried it, it's def worth trying!good food, good ingredients, beer, wine, friendly staff.... great place

I am sitting here in Naples after having the 'best' pizza here (4.5 stars with 97 reviews). Upon trying their pizza, the first thing I said to my husband was "Bricks is better".  Bravo, Bricks! Your flavorful dough and fresh ingredients are better than the "real" version in Naples.

I'm here today to make the bold claim the the best pizza in southern New England is in downtown New Bedford! I know this statement could get me jumped by a bunch of Italian dudes, but the BPN is so good that I don't even care. The crust is both crispy and doughy, thanks to the blazing-hot brick oven. I think the real star of the show is the tart sauce that gives the pizza a bite you just don't find at other places. They also have a good selection of local beers (bottles only). I know it's a 30 minute-plus ride from Providence, but you'll be converted.

This is my favorite pizza place. I will drive all the way from Newport or Warwick or wherever just to goto this place. I know 3 guys who used to work there so I was in there a lot as it was but regardless, the pizza speaks for itself. The ingredients are perfect. They had the oven shipped from Italy and had some guys from California fly over to install it or something like that. True Napoli style pizza, and they follow the guidelines to a T.Also, I got my friend who worked there into Mexican coca cola cause its so much more tastier than the standard. He got the owner into it apparently, now they serve the best coke and pizza. :-) This really may be the best pizza I've ever had... GO!

So great.  Their gluten free dough (+$2) is thin, crispy and delicious. My boyfriend is a diehard fan of their Margherita pizza. Their canolis are also to die for! An ample amount of filling with chocolate chips on the outside. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because this last time I asked to add sauce to a white pizza but it still came out with no sauce. Still delicious, but not what I had wanted.

Too expensive for the amount of pizza you get. I ordered for a take out pizza. They told me it would be ready within "5-10" minutes of my call. I waited 10 minutes, got in the car, took about 8 minutes to get there and then it wasn't even ready when I arrived. I actually waited another 15 minutes after arriving! The pizza wasn't even in the oven when I arrived. Bad service.

So good. I've been here four times in the past three weeks now and I still can't get here enough. The capricciosa should be at the top of the list by itself, it is so good. The calzones are also phenomenal and I haven't had a bad bite to eat yet. I wish, for its sake, it was busier, but so far I've never had to wait for a table and never parked more than half a block away. Highly recommended if you're even remotely close to the area.

Don't remember having anything else as good.

This might be the best pizza on the east coast.  Totally blown away by the quality and the service.  Amazing !

I think this might be my first time giving five stars to a restaurant and being completely confident about doing so. If you haven't been here before WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ?! The boyfriend and I decided to finally stop in after many months of "oh we should try that" and I was not disappointed. I got a regular calzone (extra ricotta, basil, mozzarella and red sauce) which was drizzled in a garlicky olive oil. It was absolutely amazing. Completely filled with ricotta and basil and is just heaven on a plate. Our waitress was also very  friendly and on top of things. Will be returning !

I did not see one person wearing gloves, that's ok if you wash your hands, but I saw one worker go outside then come in and start to handle food. no hand washing or sanitizing.Imagine what germs are on that door from the outside!One of the people that cleared tables, also went into the kitchen area, sorted the stuff off the tray, handled trash, then picked up an order to bring it to a table?The owner/manager or both need to sit and observe and teach anyone that enters the kitchen area safe food handling techniques.

Wasn't expecting this place at all.  Wish I had one at home because I would go there all the time.  My husband and I don't like the same ingredients on pizza. The best part is they let you get an appetizer size of any of their pizzas so we didn't have to split. Everyone in the fan left happy and full!

Just got home, stuffed from eating my entire GLUTEN FREE PIZZA brick oven pizza The best in 13 years.  They make their own crust, not the frozen cardboard most places serve.  Our server was awesome, not sure who was happier that i was enjoying it so much, her or I,  Brick is cozy clean, people are great.  Will make this a regular haunt, glad I live close!

Creative and delicious pizza.  I especially like the carmelized onion with mushrooms.  The service was friendly and fast.  Easy parking and a lovely outdoor seating area.  We always dot here on the way to the cape.

Brought Dad along for Father's day and he absolutely enjoyed it. Not only was he shocked at the freshness of their ingredients, but he also claimed that his tastebuds have been "awakened"! He also said that this was the first in a long line of lunch visits for the wonderful food offered there! Keep up the great work guys! You're officially my family's favorite pizzeria!

I was actually a little nervous heading into New Bedford to try this place but since the yelp reviews were so good and since I got sick of the chain restaurants near the hotel I headed over to give it a try. This place is simply amazing. I sat at that counter and watched the owner make the pizzas and organize them in the brick wood fire. Everything about my pizza was perfect; the dough, the toppings, the taste. Hands down one of the best pizzas I've ever had.

Killer and unique gluten free pizza! They make their own gluten free dough in house and it's amazingly doughy and chewy in the best way! Cozy and warm atmosphere and a pretty decent beer/cider and wine selection.

Everybody loves it -- read their reviews -- and they are not lying.  I stopped here on my way home from the Cape but I plan to go out of my way and drive there from Providence soon.  It's really good.

I've been to Brick a few times now, so I can definitively say, it's quite wonderful. Like most Downtown NB joints, it's such a little gem. They've expanded now, and are situated next to an open air court yard that, in the summer is quite perfect for enjoying your meal. I've had a number of different items on the menu, but the last time I visited, I started off with a glass of prosecco and the spiedini, which is prosciutto wrapped mozzarella that has been baked in their wood-fired pizza ovens and served over a lemon vinaigrette dressed arugula salad. While it tasted wonderful, the prosciutto/mozzarella, whether it had been over cooked, or out of the oven too long before being served, seemed a bit tougher than it should have been. I couldn't even tell you what I had for my main entree (I'm writing this review long after I should have). I believe I made my own pizetta (a appetizer size of any of their regular pizzas that's only $5.19 and definitely enough for one person after having an appetizer). As you can tell by their name, they cook all their pizzas to order in a brick oven, and therefore, after a short run in the million degree oven, your pizza is delivered piping hot, fresh and ready to be eaten. The cheese is gooey, the crust is doughy, with just enough bite and the toppings are all fresh. I've also had their full sized pizzas, their pizzas with salads on top and their calzones, all of which are also wonderful. I can't wait to go back and try dessert there at some point (cannolis and a nutella pizza), can you even stand it??

Pizza is prepared quickly. Short wait time. Pest Pollo was delicious. But I LOVE pesto!Spiedini for appetizer was o.k.

Delicious pizza, especially the spinaci. I love that they serve down east cider there. Definitely a cool spot, just a little too expensive to make it a regular habit.

so so good.  I have tried many diff pizzas there and they are all good.if you haven't tried it, it's def worth trying!good food, good ingredients, beer, wine, friendly staff.... great place

I am sitting here in Naples after having the 'best' pizza here (4.5 stars with 97 reviews). Upon trying their pizza, the first thing I said to my husband was "Bricks is better".  Bravo, Bricks! Your flavorful dough and fresh ingredients are better than the "real" version in Naples.

I'm here today to make the bold claim the the best pizza in southern New England is in downtown New Bedford! I know this statement could get me jumped by a bunch of Italian dudes, but the BPN is so good that I don't even care. The crust is both crispy and doughy, thanks to the blazing-hot brick oven. I think the real star of the show is the tart sauce that gives the pizza a bite you just don't find at other places. They also have a good selection of local beers (bottles only). I know it's a 30 minute-plus ride from Providence, but you'll be converted.

This is my favorite pizza place. I will drive all the way from Newport or Warwick or wherever just to goto this place. I know 3 guys who used to work there so I was in there a lot as it was but regardless, the pizza speaks for itself. The ingredients are perfect. They had the oven shipped from Italy and had some guys from California fly over to install it or something like that. True Napoli style pizza, and they follow the guidelines to a T.Also, I got my friend who worked there into Mexican coca cola cause its so much more tastier than the standard. He got the owner into it apparently, now they serve the best coke and pizza. :-) This really may be the best pizza I've ever had... GO!

So great.  Their gluten free dough (+$2) is thin, crispy and delicious. My boyfriend is a diehard fan of their Margherita pizza. Their canolis are also to die for! An ample amount of filling with chocolate chips on the outside. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because this last time I asked to add sauce to a white pizza but it still came out with no sauce. Still delicious, but not what I had wanted.

Too expensive for the amount of pizza you get. I ordered for a take out pizza. They told me it would be ready within "5-10" minutes of my call. I waited 10 minutes, got in the car, took about 8 minutes to get there and then it wasn't even ready when I arrived. I actually waited another 15 minutes after arriving! The pizza wasn't even in the oven when I arrived. Bad service.

So good. I've been here four times in the past three weeks now and I still can't get here enough. The capricciosa should be at the top of the list by itself, it is so good. The calzones are also phenomenal and I haven't had a bad bite to eat yet. I wish, for its sake, it was busier, but so far I've never had to wait for a table and never parked more than half a block away. Highly recommended if you're even remotely close to the area.

Don't remember having anything else as good.

This might be the best pizza on the east coast.  Totally blown away by the quality and the service.  Amazing !

Best crust ever!  It's all about the flavor here, so if you're looking for a heavy, gotta-go-take-a-nap-cuz-i-just-had-a-pizza pizzaria, go find another 'ria.  Watched the pizza being made from dough to table--amazed at how quickly it baked, and so pleased with the quality and flavor.  Wish I could find pizza like this back home...  It's a smidge more than I would prefer to spend for pizza, but I still highly recommend.

I wouldn't get pizza anywhere else in New Bedford, as long as Brick is open!  Its one of my favorite lunch spots, and I feel, worth every penny.  Service, always friendly, food, delicious. :)

Awesome little pizzeria in downtown New Bedford. They serve amazing wood stove pizza.  I had the pepe (pepperoni & salami) and my wife had a margerita. Both were top notch. I would count this place in among the top pizza places I have been to in MA.

Damn good pizza. We came here on a humbug because we were hungry after the long bus tide in. My gf ordered the Margherita pizza, I ordered the Funghi pizza with pepperoni added. Handmade brick oven pizza done to perfection in minutes. Awesomely delicious paired with the Harpoon Winter Warmer beer.

Funghi white pizza, spinach salad, and mango sorbet...delicious and reasonably priced.  Not greasy and good service.  They have Simpson Spring sodas, I had a recommendation of the White Birch Soda and it was a tasty beverage with my take out - mmm!

Pizza was as previously reviewed.  Very good.  Excellent.  If I lived closer I would be back.

Delicious home-made brick oven pizza.Visited for lunch today and was totally blown away.  The restaurant itself has a very new, clean feel to it, with many options for how you'd like your pie.  They have pre-named combinations of toppings, but I went ahead and made my own.  They even let you choose if you want a red or white pie.  Awesome.  Also, tons of topping choices, including my fave: goat cheese.Sat outside to eat on the nice metal deck furniture right outside, and every so often would get a glorious whiff of that brick oven smell.  Mmm.  It only took 5 minutes for our pies to cook, and the nice gent who took our order at the register brought them right out.  The whole operation was very friendly and personal feeling.  Would certainly go back.FYI - Closed on Sundays, and as of 6/15/10 are cash only.

Brick Pizzeria by far prepares and serves one of the best pizzas in New Bedford! Using only fresh premium ingredients and cooked in a wood fired brick oven was an great, tasty, and enjoyable pizza for us! At the time they were expanding their seating area for what seems to a popular place. After our visit Brick Pizzeria is now our new favorite local pizzeria. October 28

Great, fresh ingredients.  Pizzas, calzones, sandwiches...all great.  Also a good beer & wine selection.

I've been going here for about a year or so and have yet to be disappointed.This is some of the best pizza I have ever had. Excellent, excellent stuff. You can't beat their homemade sourdough crust and their toppings are phenomenal. Surprisingly good craft brew selection as well. They started doing a brunch menu recently. Haven't tried it but the menu sounds (reads?) fantastic.Brick is a must visit if you are in the area. They accept credit cards now! Awesome! Now there is no excuse not to visit.

Great authentic brick oven pizza...delicious dough, cheeses and overall quality ingredients.  High temp brick oven delivers crispy and chewy pizza.

Best neapolitan style pizza available in the south coast! Try the cannoli when you stop by :)

I had the Margherita Pizza and it was awesome. The woman who took our orders was extremely polite and the service was incredibly quick. I would wholeheartedly recommend this place. The decor was very serene and there is also space to sit outside to enjoy the breeze in Downtown New Bedford.

Awesome. Fresh. The decor is beautiful. A real brick oven pizza unlike the burnt crap they try to serve at Not Your Average Joe's. The pizza is absolutely perfect.

I ordered the Margherita pizza and about 3 minutes later, my pizza was being brought to the table.  It was delicious! Piping hot with the right combination of sauce and mozzarella cheese. The only downside for me was that there was not enough basil for my liking. I will definitely visit this restaurant again when in the area.

Best pizza I've had on a long time!  Crust, ingredients (I had the pesto pollo, yum), service and atmosphere pretty close to perfect.  This small place was not at all busy at the lunch hour downtown, surprisingly, but the quality of the pizza was notable. My only minor quibble was that although the pizza was terrific, it may have been every so slightly under-cooked, I'm not sure. It was cooked so fast I was shocked, he brought it to me in record time--so perhaps another minute or so in the brick oven would have made it absolutely perfect. But I will definitely be back once I'm in the area again with some time for lunch.

My last visit to Brick, I noticed they use La Regina DOP San Marzano tomatoes in their sauce. Awesome. These just cost more than typical Italian style tomatoes.

Visited Brick this past weekend with my boyfriend for dinner. He had the caprese pizza and I had the pesto pollo - both were delicious. Fresh ingredients go a long way for me as far as pizza is concerned. Great menu - I was really pleased with the prices. Glad there is finally some great pizza in New Bedford.

Been several times. It's owned by the same person who owns Green Bean, and is in the same building (it's where Haray's used to be), and it's great! I don't know if there's a sign up yet, but it's been open a few months and there's a flag waving outside when it is open. Brick-fired Neopolitan pizza, smaller sized (about bar-size) pizzas, with yummy chewy dough and great ingredients. I really like the pesto pollo and the carmelized onion pizza. All the pizzas have Italian names, but their menu is on the site and inside that says all the ingredients. Dine-in or takeout only, no delivery, and it's only open until 8pm or so. Highly recommended! :) Downtown needed good pizza!

GOODNESS GRACIOUS! Brick is AWESOME! The pizza is delicious. Their amazing crust, fresh homemade mozzarella (a new offering), and sauce make up some of the best basic components one could start a pizza with. The service is friendly yet laid back. Speaking of ordering well it's easy as pie because it's on a big ass chalkboard in front of you! Personal favorite: Funghi Pizza and if you're not a nincompoop add the kalamata olives. JUST TRUST ME. For the pizza lover this is definitely where to start in the New Bedford area and BEYOND!

What a great find ,some of the best pizza ever . You have it down! Super clean  fresh dough great salad too!

I am a pizza expert and this is the best I have had in New Bedford!  I live in Boston and every time I am in the area, I find an excuse to go and savor every bite.  Very good, fresh ingredients.  Quaint shop, nice service, cash only and not open Sundays are the only down sides, but the pizza is worth getting some cash and squeezing it in on Saturdays!  Love it here!

I discovered this restaurant  in downtown New Bedford while spending the day hunting for vintage clothes and antiques.I have eaten at Pizzeria Napoletana twice,excellent both times. The pizza is made in a wood grilled oven and is the best I've ever had.Staff was very friendly and helpful. You can either order from their speciality pizzas such as Napoli( with proscuitto, wood fired mushrooms roasted garlic, asiago) or Pesto Pollo (oven roasted chicken, crushed tomatoes, basil pesto, fresh mozzarella) or build your own from their long list of ingredients.I chose my own  with pesto, roasted garlic and cheese . Yum!!!!They also have salads which I haven't tried but looked very good. During our first visit my daughter had a pizza with carmelized onions, tomatoes and mushrooms.We ate in sunny front window where they have  lovely plants.They are closed on Sundays. A real treat  where I will definitely  be returning when I go antiquing in New Bedford.
