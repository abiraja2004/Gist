My husband & I have been regulars at NYAJoe's for over a decade now. We've seen staff & managers come & go through the years. Douglas will always be our favorite! What an outstanding manager, gentleman & overall fun guy! He always visits our table to say hello & ask how our meals are. Though we haven't seen him during our last few visits. The servers are exceptional & the food rarely disappoints. My favorite appetizer is the Ahi Tuna Wontons. I hope they never take it off the menu! They used to have an amazing homemade butterscotch pudding that was the best I've ever had. Still hoping they put it on as a special sometime soon. We were so bummed when they stopped serving cappuccino & let the management know each time we visited. Well, they actually listened & cared......they brought it back!! Our daughter loves their buffalo-caribbean chicken tenders & insists we get her an order to go every time she has gymnastics practice in Dartmouth. The atmosphere is fun & comfortable. The staff is sweet & helpful & the food is delicious. Joe's has been a long time favorite of ours & we highly recommend them to everyone we know.

I can not believe this establishment made their employers come to work. They even sent the manager out to pick people up. If the road the employees were not plowed, they had to walk to where the managers car was! I will NEVER eat  at this place!! Never!

This was our first time at this location. Previously we have visited the Seekonk location.We made reservations for 6 people and the table was ready and waiting on our arrival. Reservations are a must here as the dining room is on the small side and fills up quick on most nights.The server (who I forgot to get her name) was excellent.The food was generally OK. All of the food came out in a reasonable timeframe and cooked to spec. The only comment on the food was the fries had no seasoning at all on them, not even salt or pepper. I'm sure this was an oversight and I don't mind seasoning to taste at the table.Overall everyone had a good time and we would definately visit again in the future.

I went here with my mom for lunch.  We had a nice time, the food was generally good, and the service was friendly. Our orders:Me:  A latte that came at room temperature - no big deal (I ordered a second one and asked her to make it hot and it came hot).  The latte was good and less bitter than the espresso/lattes I get at Mirasol.  Vegetable spring rolls were freshly-made and tasty.  I enjoyed them.  The waitress recommended the tomato basil soup which I thought was filling and delicious.Mom:  A cheese pizza - we both thought the pizza wasn't very good.  I'm spoiled living in the pizza capital of the world but my mother lives nearby and wasn't impressed either.  I think the restaurant needs to start from the ground up with improving the pizza - better ingredients and more flavorful dough/sauce/cheese.  (For comparison, if the owners/managers are ever in Brooklyn, swing by Di Fara Pizza for the best pizza on the planet - the guy's been making pizza for about 48 years and has won more accolades citywide/nationwide/worldwide than anyone.  I'll even buy.)   :-)The bread was good but could be improved but for this type of place, it was more than fine.  I enjoyed the butter/garlic dipping sauce for the bread. Atmosphere:  It seems like a friendly place where a woman can go for a beer/drink without feeling unsafe.  The restaurant seems like a good place to grab lunch, brunch or a friendly dinner.  I do not feel that this is a romantic place but has more of a chain restaurant style and feel.  Also, it was very sunny out but I found the place kind of dark.  One wall is all large windows but I don't recall that there were windows on the other 3 sides of the building which may be why it's so dark.  Also, the ceiling is black and I have a feeling that if they painted it white or a lighter color, it might brighten up the place.  I think the place is more of a 3.5 star restaurant but there are not a lot of good restaurants in this area and it is one of the better ones, so a "4" it is!  I appreciate the fact that their food seems to be freshly-made and that the sodium level isn't off the charts as it is in so many restaurants in Southeastern Massachusetts (and even Newport).  I do think the food could be improved but they are probably trying to keep the food at a certain price point.  Having said this, we had a pleasant time with friendly service.  It's a bit of a drive from my mom's house but when I visit her, there aren't a lot of choices for non-chain, non-processed restaurant food.  I would come here, again.

My mother is GF and soy free. She doesn't really enjoy going out to eat, since she typically can't trust to eat anything out. Unfortunately, not many people understand food allergies. NYAJ understands. Not only do they offer an entire gluten free menu, that is equally as big as the normal menu, but they also serve GF bread. They really have it all.Given this, on mother's day, my mom chose to come here. We piled in the cars and schlepped over to Dartmouth. I have been here many times, and it seems like the inside has never changed. It is funky, colorful, fun, vibrant. It is interesting.I have always enjoyed the decor. I have been coming to this location for many many years, since they first opened. The one thing I can say that changed, is ever since they have franchised and opened many more stores, it seems to becoming less unique and more like another Applebee's. Their bread used to have a special kick, the food used to taste creative and fun. I think they were ahead of the times and now everyone else has caught up so it blends in more. It still is "not your average", but something just isn't the same.I will note that their menu is very fun and creative. It has a lot of options, that are unique and very flavorful. The combinations are artsy and the actual presentation is like a piece of art, gourmet.  I also like that their menu changes twice a year. There were many things I wanted to try and the menu was very appealing.I wanted every single drink on the menu! My mom got a cosmo, my dad a mojito, me a berry burst and the rest of the family got root beers. It was perfect for Annie, as she could run from the table to the door and could keep busy. The service was very fast and otherwise unremarkable. Of course my mom never had a sip of her cosmo, so I got a few extra drops of the OH. Thankfully though, because my drink tasted like it had no alchohol in it.The bread/dip is very good, but it didn't have the cheese/seasonings on it like I am used to. I got a cod special that was cooked to the T, but not anything very memorable. They also didn't give me lemon. I was so hungry that by the time my dad asked the waitress for me, I was already done eating. She did end up bringing it though. Everyone else's food was well liked and eaten fully, but we agreed at the end that for the price of the food/drinks, it wasn't worth our trip "off island". I still like the concept and food at NYAJ, but I think it lost some of the charm from my memory.**After thought. I will say that I had originally given my experience a 3. I thought a lot about this and felt bad for my rating. I feel that although my most recent experience was a 3, and I really feel that it has changed. However, I am changing it to a 4 as the manager's comment did point out we have been lifelong customers, and there is a reason that we keep coming back.. because it is "Not your average". I appreciate the managers comment and reflection to the owner, and hope that they can re-instill some of the original uniqueness.

I have been to many of this chain's locations. By far the Dartmouth location is the best. The food somehow taste better, service is better and the managers check in with the guest to make sure their experience is going well. I brought a friend and her family to this location after the NY/ Jersey hurricane and the manager gave a free appetizer and a gift card after finding out that she was from the affected area. Very nice and warm staff.

After shopping with my sister we decided on Not Your Average Joes for lunch. Very quaint inside.  It was pretty busy but the hostess seated us right away.  Our server was helpful and personable and more important seemed to like working there.  The bread was served with fresh oiled poured at the table.  The menus had a wide range of mouth watering items to temp any palette.  My sister had grilled chicken with greens that looked good.  I had a burger that was perfectly cooked on a yummy bun with lettuce, tomato and onion and side salad.  This was our first time there so the manager came over and welcomed us and gave us a welcome gift.  The whole experience was just pleasant.  I  joined the club and will get a free entree on my Birthday but won't wait that long to go back.  It made the trip to Dartmouth worth it!!I didn't realize till now that the side salad that was packed to go for to go for me was done so nicely with a note on the box stating the date and how to keep it fresh!!  It's the first time i have seen this and the first time i didn't have a mess in the bottom of the bag.  I would also like to thank you Tracey for taking the time to respond to all the reviews!!!!

I got the Smokehouse Jambalaya and my date got something else. I know that sounds  funny but she has forgotten it and she is in fact quite blonde. The laughing starts now. We looked at the menu and it isn't on there at the moment. Anyway, a busy night here the place is quite abuzz at a relatively late time. The server was not exceptional at all. She was boring. Anyway I now know that the other dinner item was 'Cranberry Teriyaki Chicken with Butternut Squash Cannelloni'. It was anyway, very very good as was my jambalaya. This was superb food, any way to look at it. The jambalaya was easily the best meal I have had of ANYTHING in a few years. The dessert was a creme brûlée cheesecake with fresh cream, raspberries and drizzled chocolate with a fresh mint leaf. No question is was as superb as it sounds. A wonderful experience. Just out of this world.

First - be aware, this is literally the ONLY game in town. It's the only decent restaurant in the area and as such, is ALWAYS packed for dinner. You HAVE to make a reservation or you will be looking at an hour wait. (Entrepreneurs, Dartmouth is calling! They need some good dining choices that aren't hideous nationwide chains!)  We're regulars here. It's one of the only places near us where my vegetarian husband and pescatarian me can get a decent meal without it turning into a bickering match. ;) Also, their price point is perfect. You can have an affordable meal, or go all out. I love their wine list and the menu is constantly, changing, so there's something new to try almost every time we pay a visit.The staff, especially the bartenders, are very welcoming and attentive. Speaking of the bar, they have a great happy hour if you make it in during the late afternoon. It's usually not that crowded and I've never had a problem getting us a seat.We've also done take out here a few times. They have a special parking area for take out orders so you can just run right in. Awesome local chain of restaurants. I've visited a couple others in the area and have had consistently great experiences.

Service was excellent. Food however was disappointing. Bread was cold, my appetizers and dish tasted like it was sitting around for a long time.. My sons pizza fell apart as soon as he picked it up. Dough was mushy. I'll stick to the location in seekonk Mass.

The food here is AWESOME! Love that bacon blue flat bread and " the peanut butter thing" along with all the other great food! After tonight though I believe this place needs new managemet. There was a table of ten where there were two boys I'd say around 10, and they were horsing around. Both kids playing with the booster seat, both sitting on top of one another the works, and hitting each other with their hats. There were no signs of a manager any where,

Good food. Well trained very friendly staff. Oil & bread very good could use a little hot pepper.  Food well done, excellent eating experience. Been here many times will definitely be here again.

Joes always has creative specials and classics on their menu. They're one of the most steadily busy restaurants in this area for this long for good reason.

We go here every other month.  The staff is alway attentive.  On the rare occasion that our order would get mixed up or it was taking a long time to get served, NYAJ always gave us one of our meals for free and then some.   The drinks and food are always exceptional!  If you sign up for their club you will get free birthday meal and desert.  My 3 to and 8 yo love it too.

A couple of years ago I came here with a group of my friends, and our waiter was so rude that two of us called to complain. It was so bad that it took me another couple of years to come in.  But in the two times that I have visited since then, I would say that the service was well above par.  I had heard from some friends about this drink called "a drink  named Bob".  I finally got in to try it, and I was very impressed.  It has sorbet In it!!  A friend of mine got the new Watermelon sangria, and she was not as impressed as I was.  She insisted that it tasted like there was no alcohol in it.  One of us ordered something that was no longer on the menu and they were happy to accommodate,  while the other two of us ordered the vegetable spring rolls.  I would honestly say that personally this is not a choice I would make again in the future for a couple of reasons.  First, the rice paper that they came wrapped it was (for me and for me only) texturally...how do I put it?...yucky.  It was rice paper, and I was told that this is how it always is, so I can't hold it against the restaurant by any means.  But secondly, long after we BOTH left the restaurant, we were still tasting the ingredients in the spring rolls.  We ended up popping gum about an hour later.  I swear there was too much cilantro or something in there.  The girl that ordered off the menu said her food was delicious.  As always, they gave us the bread and olive oil/ parmesan dipping sauce which was tasty.  So all in all, I won't be rushing to go back, but I won't stay away either

I'm vegetarian, leaning toward vegan. Our waiter was super understanding & we all had a great meal. The bread dipping oil is awesome, salad selection was great, and they aren't afraid to modify dishes to remove stuff you don't want. So good!

My wife and I went to Newport for the day and stayed at the North Dartmouth Best Western. We were looking for a good place to eat and discovered "Not your average Joes." As soon as we walked in we felt a good vibe. We were seated very quickly and were greeted by our waiter. I have a severe shellfish allergy and this restaurant really accommodated us. I saw that there were plantains on the lunch menu and it was 10 pm at the time and I asked the waiter if I could have the plantains instead of the mashed potatoes. He soon went to the back and asked the chef and without any issue I got my plantains. I was really wowed! By the customer service and friendliness. The manager at the time greeted us and brought out our food and said that "we were safe from any shellfish." Our dinner was so good and we topped it off with a great dessert! So if you're in the neighborhood you def should check this place out. Not to mention this was on a busy Saturday night!

Absolutely amazing. Loved our waitress and its unfortunate thst we noticed two different tables get stiffed by trashy customers so they could get a free meal. The food was delicious and the service was great.  Highly recommended.

Long time NYAJ's fans! Took a group there last week and service by Roxanne was terrific, attentive without being overbearing. All the entrees were hot, fresh, and cooked perfectly. The upbeat and vibrant atmosphere always leads to a fun evening and their consistency and strive to please each and every patron, even picky eaters or those with dietary restrictions, is wonderful. So proud to say NYAJ's began in our hometown! Go NYAJOE's!

I want to eat here everyday of my life. The waitress, Susan, was fantastic! The food was amazing. Can't wait to go back!

Not Your Average Joe's has been a favorite of mine since it first opened years ago. It's always an automatic 4 stars. Today it was 4 stars. Myself and my much better half arrived at 3:45 and were seated immediately. We got in before the dinner rush. Our server, I believe her name was Erin was great.... Very attentive and always there for drinks, bread, etc. She made the experience 4 stars... Both my wife and I found her to be extremely pleasant and available. We started with the chicken nacho appetizer.... Very good, actually outstanding as far as taste and presentation, not a big portion, but adequate, a bit pricey for the portion, but very tasty. We finished with the Margarita Pizza, all I can say is that it was very good. Actually very, very good. Desert was out of the question as we filled up on bread prior to our meal. All in all, it was a good experience, made better by a excellent server.

So a big group of us ended up here last night for a Skanksgiving Eve dinner.  I'll start off and say the service is excellent. Our waitress did a great job taking care of our group.  Unfortunately, I was not that pleased with my food.  The bread and sauce they lay out on the table while you wait for your food is quite tasty.  But, the backyard burger I had ordered was just average.  We waited a little longer than usual for our food but I can understand the wait considering our table had eight people.  But, I was bit disappointed when I bit into my burger and it was cold. On top of that, I asked for my burger well done and it comes out medium well.  That's always a pet peeve of mine.  I expect better food especially when the prices are a bit, well, pricy.  I'm willing to come back and try a different dish. Until then Not Your Average Joe's is just average.

Stopped here for lunch with two small kids and a nut allergy. The staff was attentive to our food allergy needs. Menu selection, service and food was excellent! We will definitely go back.

We went to Not Your Average Joe's on a Thursday night around 6:30 the wait was about 15 min. The restaurant is rather small for the amount of business that it does. The food was great I ordered the anything but average meatloaf stuffed withfresh mozzarella.  also came with roasted corn, carrot and green bean confetti, with mashed potatoes and cremains mushroom gravy.

NYA Joes is one of the best casual restruants , actually chains, around it promises and delivers. The food is consistently good, no matter which location. Particular attention is paid by management to having really pleasant staff. I will be honest the peanut butter thing on the dessert menu is just fabulous!

It is rare that I go to a restaurant simply so I can partake in their free finger food before appetizers and meals.  The onion bread with parmesan/garlic/red pepper/oil mixture is to die for (the recipe of which is posted on their website!).  I have never had a bad meal here, food has always had a savory mixture of flavor and spice.  The sirloin tips with garlic mashed potatoes and buttery green beans leaves me craving for more later in the week.Lost a star due to service.  Came here recently during a lunch time hour, place was relatively empty.  Our waitress was extremely slow, we found ourselves waiting extended periods of time just to get the check or ask for an additional condiment.  I don't mind spending time relaxing and chatting, but when you have a time limit, as we did, this slow service can get irritating VERY quickly.A few tips. . . If you are to come on any given night or weekend you must call ahead to make reservations.  Wait time can climb up to 2 hours without calling ahead.  Not worth it!  In addition, sign up for the Birthday Club on their website.  You are entitled to a free meal, anything on the menu excluding alcohol, when that special birthday of yours rolls around.  Now that's worth it!

We went for a birthday dinner last night. 4 of us had the NY strip special... The best all 4 of us ever had. Done with a blue cheese butter and balsamic glaze .  With a bottle of the Apothic red blend  wine.... PERFECTION !!!!.Our server Meagan could not have done a better job. The cinnamon apple sticks with coffee completed the perfect dinner. We've never walked out of Joe's disappointed. Made reservations online and it was a good thing. People were being told at 6pm that it was a 2 hour wait.

Had a birthday lunch here for my son's girlfriend.  I had a blueberry sangria and the Waldolf salad.  I love the bread and dipping oil here.  Our server was great.  :)

I took my mom there for a nice weekend lunch. Really good food and service. Our server was great, always there when we needed her. We order the heirloom tomato and goat cheese flatbread for the appetizer which was delicious. For entree we got the chicken piccata and the herb-crusted cod. The chicken piccata was good but the cod was extremely bland which ruined the dish. We shared the cheesecake creme brulee for dessert, probably one of the best desserts I've tasted from a restaurant. The prices are a bit high for lunch and the food menu is limited but it was worth it.

Amazing! We made a reservation but still had to wait an hour but the food, atmosphere and service were well worth it! I've even heard that if there's a lot if people waiting they come around with free pizza slices to people in the bar/waiting area. The food is well worth the wait and totally reasonably priced! Delish!

Waited an hour last Thursday evening to be seated and had to stop the dining room manager to ask him to hep us get a drink.  This took a 1/2 hour, no exaggeration.  The bar area wasn't that crowded we just didn't have a seat at the bar but hard as I tried I couldn't seem to get the attention of either bar tender. Once they got something for someone at the bar they would go into the kitchen area and stand and talk, that's why I went to the manager who was also doing the same.  I had to catch him as he finally made a pass into the dining room.  Very frustrating!  Our waitress was very attentive however.  The food was ok but it's quite expensive.  10.99 for Calamari that sits on a large piece of toasted bread. It was mostly bread with arugula, pretty but very little Calamari. Same for my entree, Chicken Chipolte Salad again 10.99.  I have been getting this salad for the last 3 years and the portion has been reduced considerably while the price has gone up.  I understand the economy is tough but this is a chain they should be able to do better. If you want to reduce your portion, that's understandable but please don't go up on your price at the same time. I will say the bread & dipping oil is always good, best thing of the evening along with the Sangria after we got it. I wish Joe's would stop focusing on being a chain and go back to being a restaurant!

I love Not Your Average Joe's and the only thing keeping it from 5 stars at this location is sometimes the wait can be over two hours, its a fairly small place and gets busy easily, and also that some of the dishes are "too extra-ordinary" meaning that the combinations just seem a bit strange rather than seem like they would taste good.Having said that, the variety of dishes and the fact that you can find foods here that you can't find anywhere else is what sets this place apart.  The menu is great for the most part, and the bread and dipping oil the meal comes with is divine. The staff is very friendly and willing to help you with any questions.  I really like it here a lot, and the wait is the only thing holding it back from 5 stars.

Was visiting a friend in the area, and she suggested Not Your Average Joe's.  Ok, I'd been to NYAJ before.  Not this one.She smartly called ahead and they were ready for us when I arrived....and she arrived a few min later with her hubby and little girl.Service was great.  Bread served when we sat.  Very tasty.Had the Southwestern Flank Steak on a bed of dirty rice.  The waitress suggested what the Chef said, that this dish was best medium rare....well, I'm a medium well kind of guy, so I confirmed the Chef wouldn't be offended, she said no.  ;)The meal was excellent!Place really started filling up after we arrived.  Always a good sign.Parking is tight when they get busy.  The signage out front could be bigger.Why no 5 stars?  It wasn't a 5 star effort....that's all.  I suspect they can do it, just not tonight.

Not your average Joes is one of my favorite places in Dartmouth/ Newbedford to go and eat. Love food when there is a fling on the average. . Great choices for us  vegetarians, lots to choose from. Go for anything dessert, wine, beer and yes try anything on the menu including the pizza.

Food was great. Their bread and oil is worth coming for all on its own. Buffalo wings were also very good. Pesto chicken penne was delicious.Service sucked. Our waitress was rude from the getgo, copping us an attitude from the minute we told her we were ready to order. Brought us the dessert menu and took our plates away when they were still 3/4 full and we clearly weren't close to done.Girl on the phone who picked up when we called to make reservations wasn't so pleasant either.Blah.

Mediocre. The pizza crust was soggy, while the burger was nondescript. Bread and dip are a nice touch, though!

Joe's bread.I guess I should say more than one phrase, even if it is one of the most delicious phrases I've ever had the pleasure of eating. Other than bread, I try to order something different every time I go. The mustard chicken, pizzas, raspberry & goat cheese salad, and "peanut butter thing" (dare I even go there with dessert?) come to mind as my favorite stand-bys if one of their pretty fantastic specials doesn't strike my fancy.A word of caution, even an average Tuesday is "not your average" Tuesday at Joe's-- we were once told the wait would be 90 minutes. Did I mention it was Tuesday? Call ahead. Always.

Overall it was a really great experience. We were seated right away, and our server Susan was nothing short of fantastic. Constantly smiling, really great service, great product knowledge, when my Stella was about 3/4 empty she was right there asking if I would like another. That really made me happy. If you have the opportunity to sit in Susan's section I would more than recommend it. The food was prompt and efficient. Crab cakes were decent the chicken enchiladas, I really enjoyed. At the end of the meal we were greeted by most likely the manager asking how everything was and an ipod attached to a cutting board. It was a survey of the overall experience and the opportunity to log in our names for a free birthday coupon by email for a free meal and desert! In a market saturated with competition, NYAJ is staying on top of their overall customer experience one customer at a time.

Not Your Average Joe's is definitely above average, but not quite a 4-star institution. The place is small, has poor parking, and is pretty popular which means that we avoid this place at all costs unless it's either during the week or for a very early dinner. It's not rare for the wait here to be 45 minutes or an hour (or more), so hitting it for a weekday lunch is highly suggested if you're trying it for the first time.The food is pretty good, with the whole concept of the restaurant based on taking 'average' foods like burgers or meatloaf and then adding an unexpected twist. The onion focaccia bread is to die for and great by itself, but it's even better when dipped in the oil which has herbs, parmesan cheese, and red pepper flakes all mixed in. The drink menu is creative and inspiring with monthly specials and a huge draw here is the bar itself. However being a small restaurant with limited table space and even more limited bar space only hurts Not Your Average Joe's.The vegetable spring rolls are a nice appetizer and if you're a fan of calamari, they make it pretty well. The menu isn't small exactly, and they do change it somewhat seasonally in addition to having a monthly specials list, but it feels limited to me. Since everything is made fresh when you order, there is a lot of room to customize and alter ingredients to fit your tastes. The Mediterranean Chicken was super moist and delicious in addition to being very light tasting and feeling. The Mustard Crusted Chicken was nice, but overall fell a little short of expectations and was a bit greasy and mushy, not fried crisp as it sounds from the menu description. Honorable mentions go to the Black Angus Meatloaf and Buffalo Chicken pizza. They have a thin crust here which is something I tend not to like but it really works with their take on 'not average' pizza.As far as dessert is concerned, they have one really standout item: their Peanut Butter Thing. It's a vanilla ice cream cake of sorts covered in Oreo cookie crumbs with chocolate and peanut butter pieces incorporated. They put the hot fudge and caramel sauce on it table side, a nice touch, but it's a little boring. For something with the word peanut butter in the title, it could stand to have more of the substance in it. The molten chocolate cake is good but a bit on the small side.

Tried this on a stop over tonight on the way to Cape Cod.  Place was packed.  We had a reservation and had to wait for a out a half hour for ur table.  The manager came out to find me before I could complain and apologized about the wait.  Within minutes we had a table.  Service was accommodating and great.  Food came out pretty fast and was very good.  Dessert was on the house due to our wait - that was a classy move.  Would return.  BTW - wine prices are outrageously low. Great buys by the glass and by the bottle.

My husband & I have been regulars at NYAJoe's for over a decade now. We've seen staff & managers come & go through the years. Douglas will always be our favorite! What an outstanding manager, gentleman & overall fun guy! He always visits our table to say hello & ask how our meals are. Though we haven't seen him during our last few visits. The servers are exceptional & the food rarely disappoints. My favorite appetizer is the Ahi Tuna Wontons. I hope they never take it off the menu! They used to have an amazing homemade butterscotch pudding that was the best I've ever had. Still hoping they put it on as a special sometime soon. We were so bummed when they stopped serving cappuccino & let the management know each time we visited. Well, they actually listened & cared......they brought it back!! Our daughter loves their buffalo-caribbean chicken tenders & insists we get her an order to go every time she has gymnastics practice in Dartmouth. The atmosphere is fun & comfortable. The staff is sweet & helpful & the food is delicious. Joe's has been a long time favorite of ours & we highly recommend them to everyone we know.

I can not believe this establishment made their employers come to work. They even sent the manager out to pick people up. If the road the employees were not plowed, they had to walk to where the managers car was! I will NEVER eat  at this place!! Never!

This was our first time at this location. Previously we have visited the Seekonk location.We made reservations for 6 people and the table was ready and waiting on our arrival. Reservations are a must here as the dining room is on the small side and fills up quick on most nights.The server (who I forgot to get her name) was excellent.The food was generally OK. All of the food came out in a reasonable timeframe and cooked to spec. The only comment on the food was the fries had no seasoning at all on them, not even salt or pepper. I'm sure this was an oversight and I don't mind seasoning to taste at the table.Overall everyone had a good time and we would definately visit again in the future.

I went here with my mom for lunch.  We had a nice time, the food was generally good, and the service was friendly. Our orders:Me:  A latte that came at room temperature - no big deal (I ordered a second one and asked her to make it hot and it came hot).  The latte was good and less bitter than the espresso/lattes I get at Mirasol.  Vegetable spring rolls were freshly-made and tasty.  I enjoyed them.  The waitress recommended the tomato basil soup which I thought was filling and delicious.Mom:  A cheese pizza - we both thought the pizza wasn't very good.  I'm spoiled living in the pizza capital of the world but my mother lives nearby and wasn't impressed either.  I think the restaurant needs to start from the ground up with improving the pizza - better ingredients and more flavorful dough/sauce/cheese.  (For comparison, if the owners/managers are ever in Brooklyn, swing by Di Fara Pizza for the best pizza on the planet - the guy's been making pizza for about 48 years and has won more accolades citywide/nationwide/worldwide than anyone.  I'll even buy.)   :-)The bread was good but could be improved but for this type of place, it was more than fine.  I enjoyed the butter/garlic dipping sauce for the bread. Atmosphere:  It seems like a friendly place where a woman can go for a beer/drink without feeling unsafe.  The restaurant seems like a good place to grab lunch, brunch or a friendly dinner.  I do not feel that this is a romantic place but has more of a chain restaurant style and feel.  Also, it was very sunny out but I found the place kind of dark.  One wall is all large windows but I don't recall that there were windows on the other 3 sides of the building which may be why it's so dark.  Also, the ceiling is black and I have a feeling that if they painted it white or a lighter color, it might brighten up the place.  I think the place is more of a 3.5 star restaurant but there are not a lot of good restaurants in this area and it is one of the better ones, so a "4" it is!  I appreciate the fact that their food seems to be freshly-made and that the sodium level isn't off the charts as it is in so many restaurants in Southeastern Massachusetts (and even Newport).  I do think the food could be improved but they are probably trying to keep the food at a certain price point.  Having said this, we had a pleasant time with friendly service.  It's a bit of a drive from my mom's house but when I visit her, there aren't a lot of choices for non-chain, non-processed restaurant food.  I would come here, again.

My mother is GF and soy free. She doesn't really enjoy going out to eat, since she typically can't trust to eat anything out. Unfortunately, not many people understand food allergies. NYAJ understands. Not only do they offer an entire gluten free menu, that is equally as big as the normal menu, but they also serve GF bread. They really have it all.Given this, on mother's day, my mom chose to come here. We piled in the cars and schlepped over to Dartmouth. I have been here many times, and it seems like the inside has never changed. It is funky, colorful, fun, vibrant. It is interesting.I have always enjoyed the decor. I have been coming to this location for many many years, since they first opened. The one thing I can say that changed, is ever since they have franchised and opened many more stores, it seems to becoming less unique and more like another Applebee's. Their bread used to have a special kick, the food used to taste creative and fun. I think they were ahead of the times and now everyone else has caught up so it blends in more. It still is "not your average", but something just isn't the same.I will note that their menu is very fun and creative. It has a lot of options, that are unique and very flavorful. The combinations are artsy and the actual presentation is like a piece of art, gourmet.  I also like that their menu changes twice a year. There were many things I wanted to try and the menu was very appealing.I wanted every single drink on the menu! My mom got a cosmo, my dad a mojito, me a berry burst and the rest of the family got root beers. It was perfect for Annie, as she could run from the table to the door and could keep busy. The service was very fast and otherwise unremarkable. Of course my mom never had a sip of her cosmo, so I got a few extra drops of the OH. Thankfully though, because my drink tasted like it had no alchohol in it.The bread/dip is very good, but it didn't have the cheese/seasonings on it like I am used to. I got a cod special that was cooked to the T, but not anything very memorable. They also didn't give me lemon. I was so hungry that by the time my dad asked the waitress for me, I was already done eating. She did end up bringing it though. Everyone else's food was well liked and eaten fully, but we agreed at the end that for the price of the food/drinks, it wasn't worth our trip "off island". I still like the concept and food at NYAJ, but I think it lost some of the charm from my memory.**After thought. I will say that I had originally given my experience a 3. I thought a lot about this and felt bad for my rating. I feel that although my most recent experience was a 3, and I really feel that it has changed. However, I am changing it to a 4 as the manager's comment did point out we have been lifelong customers, and there is a reason that we keep coming back.. because it is "Not your average". I appreciate the managers comment and reflection to the owner, and hope that they can re-instill some of the original uniqueness.

I have been to many of this chain's locations. By far the Dartmouth location is the best. The food somehow taste better, service is better and the managers check in with the guest to make sure their experience is going well. I brought a friend and her family to this location after the NY/ Jersey hurricane and the manager gave a free appetizer and a gift card after finding out that she was from the affected area. Very nice and warm staff.

After shopping with my sister we decided on Not Your Average Joes for lunch. Very quaint inside.  It was pretty busy but the hostess seated us right away.  Our server was helpful and personable and more important seemed to like working there.  The bread was served with fresh oiled poured at the table.  The menus had a wide range of mouth watering items to temp any palette.  My sister had grilled chicken with greens that looked good.  I had a burger that was perfectly cooked on a yummy bun with lettuce, tomato and onion and side salad.  This was our first time there so the manager came over and welcomed us and gave us a welcome gift.  The whole experience was just pleasant.  I  joined the club and will get a free entree on my Birthday but won't wait that long to go back.  It made the trip to Dartmouth worth it!!I didn't realize till now that the side salad that was packed to go for to go for me was done so nicely with a note on the box stating the date and how to keep it fresh!!  It's the first time i have seen this and the first time i didn't have a mess in the bottom of the bag.  I would also like to thank you Tracey for taking the time to respond to all the reviews!!!!

I got the Smokehouse Jambalaya and my date got something else. I know that sounds  funny but she has forgotten it and she is in fact quite blonde. The laughing starts now. We looked at the menu and it isn't on there at the moment. Anyway, a busy night here the place is quite abuzz at a relatively late time. The server was not exceptional at all. She was boring. Anyway I now know that the other dinner item was 'Cranberry Teriyaki Chicken with Butternut Squash Cannelloni'. It was anyway, very very good as was my jambalaya. This was superb food, any way to look at it. The jambalaya was easily the best meal I have had of ANYTHING in a few years. The dessert was a creme brûlée cheesecake with fresh cream, raspberries and drizzled chocolate with a fresh mint leaf. No question is was as superb as it sounds. A wonderful experience. Just out of this world.

First - be aware, this is literally the ONLY game in town. It's the only decent restaurant in the area and as such, is ALWAYS packed for dinner. You HAVE to make a reservation or you will be looking at an hour wait. (Entrepreneurs, Dartmouth is calling! They need some good dining choices that aren't hideous nationwide chains!)  We're regulars here. It's one of the only places near us where my vegetarian husband and pescatarian me can get a decent meal without it turning into a bickering match. ;) Also, their price point is perfect. You can have an affordable meal, or go all out. I love their wine list and the menu is constantly, changing, so there's something new to try almost every time we pay a visit.The staff, especially the bartenders, are very welcoming and attentive. Speaking of the bar, they have a great happy hour if you make it in during the late afternoon. It's usually not that crowded and I've never had a problem getting us a seat.We've also done take out here a few times. They have a special parking area for take out orders so you can just run right in. Awesome local chain of restaurants. I've visited a couple others in the area and have had consistently great experiences.

Service was excellent. Food however was disappointing. Bread was cold, my appetizers and dish tasted like it was sitting around for a long time.. My sons pizza fell apart as soon as he picked it up. Dough was mushy. I'll stick to the location in seekonk Mass.

The food here is AWESOME! Love that bacon blue flat bread and " the peanut butter thing" along with all the other great food! After tonight though I believe this place needs new managemet. There was a table of ten where there were two boys I'd say around 10, and they were horsing around. Both kids playing with the booster seat, both sitting on top of one another the works, and hitting each other with their hats. There were no signs of a manager any where,

Good food. Well trained very friendly staff. Oil & bread very good could use a little hot pepper.  Food well done, excellent eating experience. Been here many times will definitely be here again.

Joes always has creative specials and classics on their menu. They're one of the most steadily busy restaurants in this area for this long for good reason.

We go here every other month.  The staff is alway attentive.  On the rare occasion that our order would get mixed up or it was taking a long time to get served, NYAJ always gave us one of our meals for free and then some.   The drinks and food are always exceptional!  If you sign up for their club you will get free birthday meal and desert.  My 3 to and 8 yo love it too.

A couple of years ago I came here with a group of my friends, and our waiter was so rude that two of us called to complain. It was so bad that it took me another couple of years to come in.  But in the two times that I have visited since then, I would say that the service was well above par.  I had heard from some friends about this drink called "a drink  named Bob".  I finally got in to try it, and I was very impressed.  It has sorbet In it!!  A friend of mine got the new Watermelon sangria, and she was not as impressed as I was.  She insisted that it tasted like there was no alcohol in it.  One of us ordered something that was no longer on the menu and they were happy to accommodate,  while the other two of us ordered the vegetable spring rolls.  I would honestly say that personally this is not a choice I would make again in the future for a couple of reasons.  First, the rice paper that they came wrapped it was (for me and for me only) texturally...how do I put it?...yucky.  It was rice paper, and I was told that this is how it always is, so I can't hold it against the restaurant by any means.  But secondly, long after we BOTH left the restaurant, we were still tasting the ingredients in the spring rolls.  We ended up popping gum about an hour later.  I swear there was too much cilantro or something in there.  The girl that ordered off the menu said her food was delicious.  As always, they gave us the bread and olive oil/ parmesan dipping sauce which was tasty.  So all in all, I won't be rushing to go back, but I won't stay away either

I'm vegetarian, leaning toward vegan. Our waiter was super understanding & we all had a great meal. The bread dipping oil is awesome, salad selection was great, and they aren't afraid to modify dishes to remove stuff you don't want. So good!

My wife and I went to Newport for the day and stayed at the North Dartmouth Best Western. We were looking for a good place to eat and discovered "Not your average Joes." As soon as we walked in we felt a good vibe. We were seated very quickly and were greeted by our waiter. I have a severe shellfish allergy and this restaurant really accommodated us. I saw that there were plantains on the lunch menu and it was 10 pm at the time and I asked the waiter if I could have the plantains instead of the mashed potatoes. He soon went to the back and asked the chef and without any issue I got my plantains. I was really wowed! By the customer service and friendliness. The manager at the time greeted us and brought out our food and said that "we were safe from any shellfish." Our dinner was so good and we topped it off with a great dessert! So if you're in the neighborhood you def should check this place out. Not to mention this was on a busy Saturday night!

Absolutely amazing. Loved our waitress and its unfortunate thst we noticed two different tables get stiffed by trashy customers so they could get a free meal. The food was delicious and the service was great.  Highly recommended.

Long time NYAJ's fans! Took a group there last week and service by Roxanne was terrific, attentive without being overbearing. All the entrees were hot, fresh, and cooked perfectly. The upbeat and vibrant atmosphere always leads to a fun evening and their consistency and strive to please each and every patron, even picky eaters or those with dietary restrictions, is wonderful. So proud to say NYAJ's began in our hometown! Go NYAJOE's!

I want to eat here everyday of my life. The waitress, Susan, was fantastic! The food was amazing. Can't wait to go back!

Not Your Average Joe's has been a favorite of mine since it first opened years ago. It's always an automatic 4 stars. Today it was 4 stars. Myself and my much better half arrived at 3:45 and were seated immediately. We got in before the dinner rush. Our server, I believe her name was Erin was great.... Very attentive and always there for drinks, bread, etc. She made the experience 4 stars... Both my wife and I found her to be extremely pleasant and available. We started with the chicken nacho appetizer.... Very good, actually outstanding as far as taste and presentation, not a big portion, but adequate, a bit pricey for the portion, but very tasty. We finished with the Margarita Pizza, all I can say is that it was very good. Actually very, very good. Desert was out of the question as we filled up on bread prior to our meal. All in all, it was a good experience, made better by a excellent server.

So a big group of us ended up here last night for a Skanksgiving Eve dinner.  I'll start off and say the service is excellent. Our waitress did a great job taking care of our group.  Unfortunately, I was not that pleased with my food.  The bread and sauce they lay out on the table while you wait for your food is quite tasty.  But, the backyard burger I had ordered was just average.  We waited a little longer than usual for our food but I can understand the wait considering our table had eight people.  But, I was bit disappointed when I bit into my burger and it was cold. On top of that, I asked for my burger well done and it comes out medium well.  That's always a pet peeve of mine.  I expect better food especially when the prices are a bit, well, pricy.  I'm willing to come back and try a different dish. Until then Not Your Average Joe's is just average.

Stopped here for lunch with two small kids and a nut allergy. The staff was attentive to our food allergy needs. Menu selection, service and food was excellent! We will definitely go back.

We went to Not Your Average Joe's on a Thursday night around 6:30 the wait was about 15 min. The restaurant is rather small for the amount of business that it does. The food was great I ordered the anything but average meatloaf stuffed withfresh mozzarella.  also came with roasted corn, carrot and green bean confetti, with mashed potatoes and cremains mushroom gravy.

NYA Joes is one of the best casual restruants , actually chains, around it promises and delivers. The food is consistently good, no matter which location. Particular attention is paid by management to having really pleasant staff. I will be honest the peanut butter thing on the dessert menu is just fabulous!

It is rare that I go to a restaurant simply so I can partake in their free finger food before appetizers and meals.  The onion bread with parmesan/garlic/red pepper/oil mixture is to die for (the recipe of which is posted on their website!).  I have never had a bad meal here, food has always had a savory mixture of flavor and spice.  The sirloin tips with garlic mashed potatoes and buttery green beans leaves me craving for more later in the week.Lost a star due to service.  Came here recently during a lunch time hour, place was relatively empty.  Our waitress was extremely slow, we found ourselves waiting extended periods of time just to get the check or ask for an additional condiment.  I don't mind spending time relaxing and chatting, but when you have a time limit, as we did, this slow service can get irritating VERY quickly.A few tips. . . If you are to come on any given night or weekend you must call ahead to make reservations.  Wait time can climb up to 2 hours without calling ahead.  Not worth it!  In addition, sign up for the Birthday Club on their website.  You are entitled to a free meal, anything on the menu excluding alcohol, when that special birthday of yours rolls around.  Now that's worth it!

We went for a birthday dinner last night. 4 of us had the NY strip special... The best all 4 of us ever had. Done with a blue cheese butter and balsamic glaze .  With a bottle of the Apothic red blend  wine.... PERFECTION !!!!.Our server Meagan could not have done a better job. The cinnamon apple sticks with coffee completed the perfect dinner. We've never walked out of Joe's disappointed. Made reservations online and it was a good thing. People were being told at 6pm that it was a 2 hour wait.

Had a birthday lunch here for my son's girlfriend.  I had a blueberry sangria and the Waldolf salad.  I love the bread and dipping oil here.  Our server was great.  :)

I took my mom there for a nice weekend lunch. Really good food and service. Our server was great, always there when we needed her. We order the heirloom tomato and goat cheese flatbread for the appetizer which was delicious. For entree we got the chicken piccata and the herb-crusted cod. The chicken piccata was good but the cod was extremely bland which ruined the dish. We shared the cheesecake creme brulee for dessert, probably one of the best desserts I've tasted from a restaurant. The prices are a bit high for lunch and the food menu is limited but it was worth it.

Amazing! We made a reservation but still had to wait an hour but the food, atmosphere and service were well worth it! I've even heard that if there's a lot if people waiting they come around with free pizza slices to people in the bar/waiting area. The food is well worth the wait and totally reasonably priced! Delish!

Waited an hour last Thursday evening to be seated and had to stop the dining room manager to ask him to hep us get a drink.  This took a 1/2 hour, no exaggeration.  The bar area wasn't that crowded we just didn't have a seat at the bar but hard as I tried I couldn't seem to get the attention of either bar tender. Once they got something for someone at the bar they would go into the kitchen area and stand and talk, that's why I went to the manager who was also doing the same.  I had to catch him as he finally made a pass into the dining room.  Very frustrating!  Our waitress was very attentive however.  The food was ok but it's quite expensive.  10.99 for Calamari that sits on a large piece of toasted bread. It was mostly bread with arugula, pretty but very little Calamari. Same for my entree, Chicken Chipolte Salad again 10.99.  I have been getting this salad for the last 3 years and the portion has been reduced considerably while the price has gone up.  I understand the economy is tough but this is a chain they should be able to do better. If you want to reduce your portion, that's understandable but please don't go up on your price at the same time. I will say the bread & dipping oil is always good, best thing of the evening along with the Sangria after we got it. I wish Joe's would stop focusing on being a chain and go back to being a restaurant!

I love Not Your Average Joe's and the only thing keeping it from 5 stars at this location is sometimes the wait can be over two hours, its a fairly small place and gets busy easily, and also that some of the dishes are "too extra-ordinary" meaning that the combinations just seem a bit strange rather than seem like they would taste good.Having said that, the variety of dishes and the fact that you can find foods here that you can't find anywhere else is what sets this place apart.  The menu is great for the most part, and the bread and dipping oil the meal comes with is divine. The staff is very friendly and willing to help you with any questions.  I really like it here a lot, and the wait is the only thing holding it back from 5 stars.

Was visiting a friend in the area, and she suggested Not Your Average Joe's.  Ok, I'd been to NYAJ before.  Not this one.She smartly called ahead and they were ready for us when I arrived....and she arrived a few min later with her hubby and little girl.Service was great.  Bread served when we sat.  Very tasty.Had the Southwestern Flank Steak on a bed of dirty rice.  The waitress suggested what the Chef said, that this dish was best medium rare....well, I'm a medium well kind of guy, so I confirmed the Chef wouldn't be offended, she said no.  ;)The meal was excellent!Place really started filling up after we arrived.  Always a good sign.Parking is tight when they get busy.  The signage out front could be bigger.Why no 5 stars?  It wasn't a 5 star effort....that's all.  I suspect they can do it, just not tonight.

Not your average Joes is one of my favorite places in Dartmouth/ Newbedford to go and eat. Love food when there is a fling on the average. . Great choices for us  vegetarians, lots to choose from. Go for anything dessert, wine, beer and yes try anything on the menu including the pizza.

Food was great. Their bread and oil is worth coming for all on its own. Buffalo wings were also very good. Pesto chicken penne was delicious.Service sucked. Our waitress was rude from the getgo, copping us an attitude from the minute we told her we were ready to order. Brought us the dessert menu and took our plates away when they were still 3/4 full and we clearly weren't close to done.Girl on the phone who picked up when we called to make reservations wasn't so pleasant either.Blah.

Mediocre. The pizza crust was soggy, while the burger was nondescript. Bread and dip are a nice touch, though!

Joe's bread.I guess I should say more than one phrase, even if it is one of the most delicious phrases I've ever had the pleasure of eating. Other than bread, I try to order something different every time I go. The mustard chicken, pizzas, raspberry & goat cheese salad, and "peanut butter thing" (dare I even go there with dessert?) come to mind as my favorite stand-bys if one of their pretty fantastic specials doesn't strike my fancy.A word of caution, even an average Tuesday is "not your average" Tuesday at Joe's-- we were once told the wait would be 90 minutes. Did I mention it was Tuesday? Call ahead. Always.

Overall it was a really great experience. We were seated right away, and our server Susan was nothing short of fantastic. Constantly smiling, really great service, great product knowledge, when my Stella was about 3/4 empty she was right there asking if I would like another. That really made me happy. If you have the opportunity to sit in Susan's section I would more than recommend it. The food was prompt and efficient. Crab cakes were decent the chicken enchiladas, I really enjoyed. At the end of the meal we were greeted by most likely the manager asking how everything was and an ipod attached to a cutting board. It was a survey of the overall experience and the opportunity to log in our names for a free birthday coupon by email for a free meal and desert! In a market saturated with competition, NYAJ is staying on top of their overall customer experience one customer at a time.

Not Your Average Joe's is definitely above average, but not quite a 4-star institution. The place is small, has poor parking, and is pretty popular which means that we avoid this place at all costs unless it's either during the week or for a very early dinner. It's not rare for the wait here to be 45 minutes or an hour (or more), so hitting it for a weekday lunch is highly suggested if you're trying it for the first time.The food is pretty good, with the whole concept of the restaurant based on taking 'average' foods like burgers or meatloaf and then adding an unexpected twist. The onion focaccia bread is to die for and great by itself, but it's even better when dipped in the oil which has herbs, parmesan cheese, and red pepper flakes all mixed in. The drink menu is creative and inspiring with monthly specials and a huge draw here is the bar itself. However being a small restaurant with limited table space and even more limited bar space only hurts Not Your Average Joe's.The vegetable spring rolls are a nice appetizer and if you're a fan of calamari, they make it pretty well. The menu isn't small exactly, and they do change it somewhat seasonally in addition to having a monthly specials list, but it feels limited to me. Since everything is made fresh when you order, there is a lot of room to customize and alter ingredients to fit your tastes. The Mediterranean Chicken was super moist and delicious in addition to being very light tasting and feeling. The Mustard Crusted Chicken was nice, but overall fell a little short of expectations and was a bit greasy and mushy, not fried crisp as it sounds from the menu description. Honorable mentions go to the Black Angus Meatloaf and Buffalo Chicken pizza. They have a thin crust here which is something I tend not to like but it really works with their take on 'not average' pizza.As far as dessert is concerned, they have one really standout item: their Peanut Butter Thing. It's a vanilla ice cream cake of sorts covered in Oreo cookie crumbs with chocolate and peanut butter pieces incorporated. They put the hot fudge and caramel sauce on it table side, a nice touch, but it's a little boring. For something with the word peanut butter in the title, it could stand to have more of the substance in it. The molten chocolate cake is good but a bit on the small side.

Tried this on a stop over tonight on the way to Cape Cod.  Place was packed.  We had a reservation and had to wait for a out a half hour for ur table.  The manager came out to find me before I could complain and apologized about the wait.  Within minutes we had a table.  Service was accommodating and great.  Food came out pretty fast and was very good.  Dessert was on the house due to our wait - that was a classy move.  Would return.  BTW - wine prices are outrageously low. Great buys by the glass and by the bottle.
