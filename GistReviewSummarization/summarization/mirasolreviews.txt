This place is WELL KNOWN around here. The Patriots regularly order from them, and we can tell if you're not from around here if you don't know what a Chippi is. It's like our barometer for how New England you are. I go to UMASS so I stop here a few times a week. For the COFFEE that is (and the blueberry mini scones), because a Chippi is wicked expensive. They're reserved for finals week, where they're needed most. Alas, they don't know how to make a real cuban coffee - but I don't expect that anywhere sans Miami.

I am a huge fan of Mirasols, have been ever since the Chippi was recommended to me quite some time ago. And if you are going for the first time... You have to try the Chippi. It's a delicious combo of actual coffee and coffee milk, with a ton of caffeine. I wish I could figure out their secret recipe, because it's addicting. You can also buy Chippi by the gallon, which I have been known to do for morning gatherings and Christmas gifts. But there is more than just the Chippi. The have a huge variety of coffee drinks, smoothies, hot cocoa. Their vanilla chai is the best I've had (maybe ever!). And there food is also amazing, for breakfast or lunch. My recommendation for breakfast is the Gringa Loca, which is fried egg, cheese and turkey bacon inside a wrap. For lunch-- the Chilena, which is marinated steak, green beans, lettuce and avocado spread (I get mine sans tomatoes). Their quesadillas are awesome as well.And great service. They move things as quickly as possible especially considering if you show up at peak times, there is a line out the door. The only thing that keeps Mirasols from being a 5 star coffee shop are the prices, and the parking lot.Paying $8 for a sandwich or $5.50 for a breakfast wrap is ok because the quality is so much better than a fast food place. But the beverages are a little on the pricey side in my opinion. My biggest gripe with Mirasols is the parking lot. I know they recently did some work so there are now more spots but it is still almost impossible to park in the lot, and when you do, beware of pedestrians and other cars. I can't believe I haven't heard of cars hitting each other in that lot on a regular basis.But if you don't mind parking across the street at Wendy's, and don't mind paying $4.50 for a drink.... You will not be disappointed!

Don't expect this to be a *quick* lunch stop. Make sure you have time to wait for your food to be made, even if its a cold sandwich to go. The food is heavily seasoned, down to the lettuce on the wraps, and I'm not complaining! Its refreshing to get a tasty decent priced sandwich that is bursting with flavor. I've had the vegetarian with the cilantro hummus and marinated onions, and today I opted for the curry cumin chicken salad wrap. It took slightly over 15 minutes to order and receive my wrap in its little white to go bag. The girls working all seemed to be in a hipster stepford state. Lots of winged liner and attitude like they don't need to be there helping you.

My go-to café! I love the atmosphere in Mirsasol's and the service is always on point.I'm not into the Chippi's since much of the cream upsets my stomach, but if you're into that type of drink- you must try!The food here is delicious. I love all of the sandwiches and the feta & spinach stuffed croissant is absolutely amazing.

Finally tried the famous Chippi, and it's so darn good! Bf had latte with whipped cream!They serve local coffee (even better)! Glass cases of yummy-looking pastries. Staff is very friendly. So many kids and students hanging out here (from nearby UMass) with their laptops. I feel like I'm the oldest person here.

Love this hip coffee shop. I ordered a delish Soy Chai Latte. My man ordered an Eggnog Expresso and it was divine (I had a sip). Friendly staff and a cool vibe. This place caters to the local college crowd. Plenty of seats and WIFI to while away the hours. We had cookies to go with our coffee. Not sure if they are homemade (versus a commercial mix) but plenty of choices. The Chippie seems to be the go to drink at this hot spot.

I have been hearing about Chippis for a few years, and finally got to try my first! It's like melted coffee ice cream in a cup that you're allowed to drink without your mom yelling at you. So. Good. We got Chippi lites, so I'm not sure what the full experience is like, but I am so willing to go back and find out. I would be pretty clear that this is not an iced coffee... this is vaguely coffee flavoured sweet thick creaminess. Throw a little vodka in there and we could have a terrific time. We didn't order food but the menu looked appetizing and reasonably priced.

Plan on spending a few extra bucks when coming here. The chippi is good. It tastes like iced coffee milk. It's clean and fun inside and the staff is usually really friendly. They also have a full menu of lunch and breakfast and a case full of sweets and bagels.

Great coffee, but be prepared to wait... Totally worth it!!  Not sure how to really describe the chippy, but it's awesome and everyone should try it.

Okay so I'm recently obsessed with coffee milk, so my good friend said that I HAD to try a Chippi. Best. Coffee. Ever. If you loooove coffee, milk and sugar, well then here you go. It tastes exactly like coffee ice cream. I'm not exactly sure what's in it...but does anyone? I guess it's a big secret recipe. Honestly it's a hyped up coffee milk/iced coffee. This isn't a complaint or a flaw. I loved every sip. I honestly can't give a review on much of anything else. They offer an array of different things from quesadillas to sandwiches to pastries. They had an array of cookies and so I indulged in my favorite: white chip macadamia. It was awesome and soft just the way I like it. The service was fast and friendly. It didn't seem too packed. Very small parking lot though. It seemed rather clean as well. I'm never in the Dartmouth area, so I won't be returning. But if I was, I'd definitely be returning for a Chippi coffee and cookies.

Good coffee, good food and a real college scene.  It's all about the "Chippy" coffee drink. Convenient location on Rte. 6 near the Dartmouth Mall.

Be prepared to not get a parking spot near the front, but the aggravation is totally worth it for the sandwiches and the Chippi. I usually end up getting the spicy sexy asparagus sandwich, but you also can't go wrong with the Cuban (it's probably the best cuban sandwich you'll find north of Miami)

By far one place I highly recommend you try for delicious food and drink. The only downside is the small parking lot. Great menu and prices are reasonable. A nice casual eatery!

This place is the absolutely best cafe that I have ever stepped foot in. The food is great, coffee amazing and the staff is incredible. Their signature drink Chippi is the best ice coffee that I have ever had. It's addictive and very tasty. In the summer mirasols has great outdoor seating and the atmosphere of the cafe itself is brilliant. Mirasols Cafe is a highlight of southern mass and has a large potential for growth. By the way did you know you can order a Chocolate Chippi?

LOVE. IT.That Chippi - while I know it's basically liquid sugar - is great. No, it's delicious.

I really, really want to love this place. My review is limited because I've only ever ordered a chippi and a few different kinds of cookies.The chippis are really good, but so sweet. Definitely not something I'd get all the time. The cookies, especially the monster cookie, are very good as well, however this place really frustrates me. The thing that annoys me the most is the whole parking situation. It's a rare and glorious miracle to get a parking spot up front. If you're lucky you can park in the back. If you're unlucky like me, you have to park at Wendy's and walk across the street. If you do manage to snag a spot on the side of the building, good luck trying to back out! People park behind those spots on the side of the curb, which sometimes allows enough room to back up, but some people can't park to save their lives. Most of the time I find myself just driving by and going somewhere else because I don't want to deal with the frustration of getting in and out.There are a few members of the staff that I've never seen crack a smile. Most seem generally happy and smiley, but they're lacking some serious people skills. I haven't tried any of the food, so I cannot comment on that. However, I don't really have the desire to try anything.I'd definitely recommend it if you haven't tried it, but I find it's usually not worth it.

Excellent place, some say a bit pricey, but only compared to Dunkin'. The quality is outstanding, and I've never had anything that was below excellent. The only thing tough, rough, or in anyway unlikable can be the crowd this place gets when UMass Dartmouth is in session.

Everything was just alright.  Their special sandwich at the moment: crab cake sandwich.  It ended up not being too special - it was seasoned ok, lots of black pepper.  A bit messy with shredded lettuce falling out left and right.  I wish there was a special aioli that came with it or something to make it more interesting.This is the kind of place that's good to stop in for a cup of coffee or tea - they have a lot of choices and it seems to be the only cafe I've really seen in the area that's not a chain.  Aside from the variety of beverages, they had some appealing menu options for lunch as well as a display of delicious looking baked treats. The cafe server who took my order was nice.  Service wasn't fast or slow.  They have kitschy decor and giant flower painted glass - a very lawn ornament like vibe so far.  Their famous Chippie drink was advertised with The Emperor's New Groove llama, a fun choice - I was a fan of the movie, but it made me wonder what vibe this place is going for - crazy looking caffeinated llama on one hand and giant colorful flowers on the other. Interesting.This place has potential, but I've had better cafe and sandwich experiences at many other places, including cafe chains.  I think I'll stick to basic tea and cookies if there's a next time.

Strongly recommend the Chippi if you've never tried this cup of magical cup of goodness. They will not tell you what is in the secret recipe, but it is delicious and worth the money ($4.50 for a medium). Cookies and other baked goods are also good and reasonable and fresh in the morning. Sandwiches are made to order. Beware card users, $3.50 card minimum!

Yup not a fan. I know everyone is obsessed with this place and i have no idea why. Sure their regular coffee is good but the whole Chippi ordeal aggravates me. All you're paying for is a ridiculously over priced coffee milk....seriously. Ya it tastes good but i can get the same thing from my fridge. Plus if i stay home i don't to pay extra just to get more ice. But like the workers there rudely say; "less ice means more chippi". Well no kidding. I thought the extra room meant it would be filled with gold.

Pretentious hippy crap like quinoa sandwiches and wheat germ. Coffee was uninspiring. Pass!

One of my favorite lunch spots when I am in Dartmouth. I have only had a few of the sandwiches because I can't seem to stop myself from ordering the Chilena sandwich every time I go there. It is delicious. Coffee is great too. Complain about the parking??? It's crowded because it is good, DUH... not sure what others are talking about regarding staff , they are always friendly and prompt.

Amazing little place in Dartmouth. The staff is friendly and the food is cooked fresh. The atmosphere is very inviting with quirky signs and fun color schemes. Its known for the "Chippi" a supercharged iced coffee which my wife orders every time. The breakfast sandwiches are great for the price. I ordered a "gaucho" steak and eggs in a baguette that had generous portions for the price. The wife said the egg, turkey, bacon tortilla was really good too. Cant wait to come back!

Never a disappointment!!! A great place to kick back read a book and savor some wonderful coffee's from around the world. The menu features both breakfast and lunch sandwiches which are done with some South American flare. The staff are always friendly and accommodating they really enjoy working there,a testament to the owner who I see there often engaging his customers with a smile. Looking forward to my next day off read a few chapters grab a bite and a java

After my wife's recent visit with postive experience, I decided to grab a quick bite with kids last night.  Went there about 5pm and the place is not busy at all, besides the occasional folks walk in for coffee there may be one table (of two people) seating for food.Not wanting to spend hours understanding their menu, I elected to ordered the basic stuff - Ice coffee and tuna melt.  Both are ok and defintely not something I would develop a craving to come back for.  To be honest for $6 (sandwich) I'd expect to get a small bag of chips on the side.  My daughter ordered some other sandwhich and it looked as dry as mine.  My son ordered a kids turkey and its literally a slice of turkey and a slice of cheese roll witnhin a soft taco shell.  I was told ahead by the cashier there will be no lettuce or tomatoe (which is ok).  But I am surprised not to see any sort of sauce on it (mayo?).  Visually its pretty non inspring piece of food.  He took one bite and lost interest.  The wait for the food is longer than I expected for 3 simple sandwiches (though mine and my daughter's sandwich are warm...so maybe the time is to press them).  I had to walk back to the counter to make sure I have not been forgoten.  After the reminder the food came shortly after.  Cleanliness of this place is ok.  My expectation is not high for any cafe knowing they typically won't wipe tables promptly so patrons often need to dust the crumbs off table/seat before settlng in.  Such is the case last night with our table.  Overall this is not a place I would actively seek out opportunity to go back since there was nothing that really grabbed me from my experience last night.  That said I do understand their charm and appeal to college crowd and those looking for a casual setting for a quick bite.

The chippy was tasty but extremely sweet. Taste exactly like coffee milk or coffee ice cream. Had a vanilla latte. It was okay, but nothing special. Service was good.

Best cafe in this area by far. Chances are you could have your best cup of coffee here(I'm fairly certain they cold brew their coffee's here or something). I've never been disappointed by drinks or food that comes out of this place. The chippis must have crack in them. They are so good. Its a little creamier than I'd like it to be but if you like autocrat coffee milk, then you have to try a chippi. You'll be wired from it and hooked in no time. The price really is outrageous for a chippi though, it's really dumb.Either way, don't miss trying this place!

I have never understood all of the complaints about the staff here. I have been coming to Mirasols for years and have not once been treated rudely. It has actually been the exact opposite. The owner, even though a bit stoic, has always been very polite and nice towards me and everyone around me. When it comes to the food I have tried almost everything off the menu and have enjoyed almost everything (try the asparagus sandwich and chicken quesadilla.) The specials can be hit or miss but the soups are almost always really good. Parking is definitely an issue if you're going during lunch time, sometimes even in the morning. Overall, I have never  personally had a major issue with this place and will always recommend it to people.

This place is pretty great. They have a good selection of Latin American inspired cold and hot sandwiches... and some of the best quesadillas in the area. The ingredients taste fresh and are well put together.The drinks are just as tasty. I really enjoy the oreo smoothie and the frozen hot chocolate. Their fruit smoothies are great as well. I even enjoy their signature coffee drink--the Chippi--even though I'm not a big coffee drinker in general.I don't always order them, but their baked goods are great too.

Mirasol's is a decent place to grab a bite. The food is really pretty good. The coffee is good but they seem to really only specialize in the "chippi" which I have had a sip of. It's pure sugar and caffeine, not really my thing. I would have given it four or even five stars because I want so badly to love this place, but it's always overcrowded and LOUD and the servers just never seem happy to be making you a coffee. I don't expect a song or dance but I mean a smile from a customer service person would do wonders. I don't want to feel guilty for ordering a coffee.

This place  is always busy and parking is difficult,but they have a good system where they can take care of orders quickly.   They know what they are doing here when it comes to a tasty cup of coffee and your options are endless.  The service has always been friendly.   I wish they had a drive through, but that would make things even crazier.

I was introduced to this place by a friend who absolutely loved chippis and I didn't understand the hype until I actually started going to mirasols. The chippi, while it is an amazing pick me up I wish I could drink all the time, is secondary to their food. The quesadillas are served with the best guacamole I've ever had, and are filled with all sorts of delicious things that come together in the most wonderful way. The portion sizes are gigantic, two people can easily share one quesadilla and feel satisfied. If you're still feeling a little hungry or are in the mood for dessert try the Reese's cookie, something I bring back for my sister all the time. It's got huge Reese's chunks, and it's only $2 for a BIG cookie. They also have a variety of bakery items, like bagels, pastries etc which I look forward to trying in the future. As for pricing, my sister and I shared the quesadilla, a cookie and got two drinks (chippi and the ice tea of the day) for $17. We left full and with a little bit to take home too! That's a good deal if you ask me! Highly recommend this place, so wish we had one closer to newport!

I have only tried one thing on the menu here, because there is only two or three vegetarian selctions on the menu and contrary to popular belief, vegetarians are just like the rest of the world and we don't always like all vegetables.  Personally, I hate mushrooms.  But anyways, The food tasted good, but I had much difficulty eating my black bean and corn quesadilla. the filling kept falling out, and the wax paper underneath was getting soggy and sticking to things.  But it is a good place to go with a friend as there should be something on the menu that everyone likes.  Oh and they have (as of the last time I checked) a kids corner, which came in handy for my friend's two year old.

Try the Chippi if you've never had one!!!The food is very good too.  Nice relaxing place to visit for lunch, bruch, breakfast

Been here multiple times. Chippi's are awesome. Food overall is good. On today's visit sandwich's were a bit too spicy. Had tuna melt and wife had asparugus (sp?) sanwich. Overall cool cafe for a light breakfast and/or lunch. Cool atmosphere.

The internet rarely works and there is a $3.50 minimum on debit cards.   Other than that not a bad place.

All i can say is yum!!!    10 Stars!

Do not leave without getting the famous Chippi!

Love this place, coffee is great, food is good and the atmosphere is laid back. It is a tad pricey, and doesn't stay open very late, but it's worth a stop!

Although they are famous for their chippi, I favor the lattes. Delicious and reasonably priced. Their food is fresh, cafe is cute and there is plenty of sitting room. Whoever maintains the facebook page keeps me informed and entertained. I just love this place and am always in the mood.

This place is WELL KNOWN around here. The Patriots regularly order from them, and we can tell if you're not from around here if you don't know what a Chippi is.

After my wife's recent visit with postive experience, I decided to grab a quick bite with kids last night.  Went there about 5pm and the place is not busy at all, besides the occasional folks walk in for coffee there may be one table (of two people) seating for food.Not wanting to spend hours understanding their menu, I elected to ordered the basic stuff - Ice coffee and tuna melt.  Both are ok and defintely not something I would develop a craving to come back for.  To be honest for $6 (sandwich) I'd expect to get a small bag of chips on the side.  My daughter ordered some other sandwhich and it looked as dry as mine.  My son ordered a kids turkey and its literally a slice of turkey and a slice of cheese roll witnhin a soft taco shell.  I was told ahead by the cashier there will be no lettuce or tomatoe (which is ok).  But I am surprised not to see any sort of sauce on it (mayo?).  Visually its pretty non inspring piece of food.  He took one bite and lost interest.  The wait for the food is longer than I expected for 3 simple sandwiches (though mine and my daughter's sandwich are warm...so maybe the time is to press them).  I had to walk back to the counter to make sure I have not been forgoten.  After the reminder the food came shortly after.  Cleanliness of this place is ok.  My expectation is not high for any cafe knowing they typically won't wipe tables promptly so patrons often need to dust the crumbs off table/seat before settlng in.  Such is the case last night with our table.  Overall this is not a place I would actively seek out opportunity to go back since there was nothing that really grabbed me from my experience last night.  That said I do understand their charm and appeal to college crowd and those looking for a casual setting for a quick bite.

The chippy was tasty but extremely sweet. Taste exactly like coffee milk or coffee ice cream. Had a vanilla latte. It was okay, but nothing special. Service was good.

Best cafe in this area by far. Chances are you could have your best cup of coffee here(I'm fairly certain they cold brew their coffee's here or something). I've never been disappointed by drinks or food that comes out of this place. The chippis must have crack in them. They are so good. Its a little creamier than I'd like it to be but if you like autocrat coffee milk, then you have to try a chippi. You'll be wired from it and hooked in no time. The price really is outrageous for a chippi though, it's really dumb.Either way, don't miss trying this place!

I have never understood all of the complaints about the staff here. I have been coming to Mirasols for years and have not once been treated rudely. It has actually been the exact opposite. The owner, even though a bit stoic, has always been very polite and nice towards me and everyone around me. When it comes to the food I have tried almost everything off the menu and have enjoyed almost everything (try the asparagus sandwich and chicken quesadilla.) The specials can be hit or miss but the soups are almost always really good. Parking is definitely an issue if you're going during lunch time, sometimes even in the morning. Overall, I have never  personally had a major issue with this place and will always recommend it to people.

This place is pretty great. They have a good selection of Latin American inspired cold and hot sandwiches... and some of the best quesadillas in the area. The ingredients taste fresh and are well put together.The drinks are just as tasty. I really enjoy the oreo smoothie and the frozen hot chocolate. Their fruit smoothies are great as well. I even enjoy their signature coffee drink--the Chippi--even though I'm not a big coffee drinker in general.I don't always order them, but their baked goods are great too.

Mirasol's is a decent place to grab a bite. The food is really pretty good. The coffee is good but they seem to really only specialize in the "chippi" which I have had a sip of. It's pure sugar and caffeine, not really my thing. I would have given it four or even five stars because I want so badly to love this place, but it's always overcrowded and LOUD and the servers just never seem happy to be making you a coffee. I don't expect a song or dance but I mean a smile from a customer service person would do wonders. I don't want to feel guilty for ordering a coffee.

This place  is always busy and parking is difficult,but they have a good system where they can take care of orders quickly.   They know what they are doing here when it comes to a tasty cup of coffee and your options are endless.  The service has always been friendly.   I wish they had a drive through, but that would make things even crazier.

I was introduced to this place by a friend who absolutely loved chippis and I didn't understand the hype until I actually started going to mirasols. The chippi, while it is an amazing pick me up I wish I could drink all the time, is secondary to their food. The quesadillas are served with the best guacamole I've ever had, and are filled with all sorts of delicious things that come together in the most wonderful way. The portion sizes are gigantic, two people can easily share one quesadilla and feel satisfied. If you're still feeling a little hungry or are in the mood for dessert try the Reese's cookie, something I bring back for my sister all the time. It's got huge Reese's chunks, and it's only $2 for a BIG cookie. They also have a variety of bakery items, like bagels, pastries etc which I look forward to trying in the future. As for pricing, my sister and I shared the quesadilla, a cookie and got two drinks (chippi and the ice tea of the day) for $17. We left full and with a little bit to take home too! That's a good deal if you ask me! Highly recommend this place, so wish we had one closer to newport!

I have only tried one thing on the menu here, because there is only two or three vegetarian selctions on the menu and contrary to popular belief, vegetarians are just like the rest of the world and we don't always like all vegetables.  Personally, I hate mushrooms.  But anyways, The food tasted good, but I had much difficulty eating my black bean and corn quesadilla. the filling kept falling out, and the wax paper underneath was getting soggy and sticking to things.  But it is a good place to go with a friend as there should be something on the menu that everyone likes.  Oh and they have (as of the last time I checked) a kids corner, which came in handy for my friend's two year old.

Try the Chippi if you've never had one!!!The food is very good too.  Nice relaxing place to visit for lunch, bruch, breakfast

Been here multiple times. Chippi's are awesome. Food overall is good. On today's visit sandwich's were a bit too spicy. Had tuna melt and wife had asparugus (sp?) sanwich. Overall cool cafe for a light breakfast and/or lunch. Cool atmosphere.

The internet rarely works and there is a $3.50 minimum on debit cards.   Other than that not a bad place.

All i can say is yum!!!    10 Stars!

Do not leave without getting the famous Chippi!

Love this place, coffee is great, food is good and the atmosphere is laid back. It is a tad pricey, and doesn't stay open very late, but it's worth a stop!

Although they are famous for their chippi, I favor the lattes. Delicious and reasonably priced. Their food is fresh, cafe is cute and there is plenty of sitting room. Whoever maintains the facebook page keeps me informed and entertained. I just love this place and am always in the mood.
